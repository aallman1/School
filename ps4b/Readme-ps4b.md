# PS4a: Sokoban

## Description
Builds a Sokoban game initialized from an input stream.

### Features
Fixes:
- Upon further playthrough, discovered a bug with indexing the matrix. This disrupted some proper crate interaction. The proper changes have been made.
- Clean up garbage from output with extraction operator.
- Removed vscode, autogenerated headstones
- Switched victory theme to royalty free. I like "The Price is Right Theme" a lot, but I have not been in touch with CBS.

Again, I'm not particulary pleased with how this one went. Wish I had started the semester off ahead of the game. Only a projects I've had all the time I wanted to explore the concepts in depth. 

Previous:
The upfront containerizing made interacting with the resources somewhat verbose in some cases. I tried to minimize time complexity,
most of the move logic operations are implemented via switch, with crate information stored in an unordered map, so depending on the compiler, a lot of this should run with constant complexity. Got a bit carried away with the win sequence.

### Algorithm/Data Structures
Used unorded map for crate position information for constant time operations. Uses std::copy for copying contents of ostream to string for initializing string stream. To be forthright, I had already written the entire project and included this as a requirement. It adds no value the way I wrote, in fact it's redundant. I'm sure there were points along the way I could've made better use of the library.

### Issues
Had some difficulty getting a stringstream object to read back into a new sGame object. Again, to be forthright, I didn't figure this one out. I found by converting the string stream data into a string, and initializing a stringstream object with that string, it read back in fine. My guess is either temporary variable issue or null-termination.

Was initially indexing the matrix for crates via the scheme (i * j + n_columns), which should have been (i * n_columns + j). This has been fixed.
I've actually had a number of difficulties with properly indexing mn matrices over the last couple of weeks.

### Extra Credit
Player changes direction when moving.
Plays sound on victory.
Play looks into the direction of last move on victory.
Boxes turn green when set, and can't be removed.
